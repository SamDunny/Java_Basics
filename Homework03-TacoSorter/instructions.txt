Taco Sorter!

Due 10/16/2020 at 11:55PM

 

Objective:

 

Write a program that sorts prices of 10 tacos in ascending order based on the price, using arrays.

 

Requirements:

The user enters the name of the taco and then the price of the taco
HINT: Two arrays make this problem simpler.  One with the names and the other with the prices. The indices indicate the combination. For instance, a taco price at index 5 has its name also at index 5 of the other array.
HINT: It is a good idea that after using keyboard.nextDouble() to write the following line: keyboard.nextLine();. The scanner will not consume everything in the buffer unless you tell it to using nextLine. 
After 10 tacos are entered they are sorted based on the price
You can use any sorting method such as bubble sort or selection sort
Display the results at the end
Arrays must be part of the solution, and other built in Java data structures, such as ArrayLists, may not be used.
Sorting must be implemented (bubble sort, selection sort, etc.)  in the solution, and other built in Java sorters may not be used.
