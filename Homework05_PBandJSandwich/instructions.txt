Peanut Butter and Jelly Sandwich

 

Objective:

Practice object-oriented principles by making two Peanut Butter and Jelly Sandwiches. The program must create two sandwiches based on user input. The sandwich information for both must then print out their details and determine if the two sandwiches are equal.

 

Requirements: 

Write a class called Bread with the following

Instance Variables
Name: The name brand of the bread.
o   Calories: The number of calories per slice assumed to be between 50 and 250 inclusively.

Type: The kind of bread. This can either be “Honey Wheat”, “White”, “Whole Grain”, or “Whole Wheat”.
Methods
Accessors and Mutators for the instance variables
Make sure in the mutators check for valid values named in the Instance Variable Section.
Equals: This method takes in another instance of Bread and only returns true if all of the instance variables match. For name and type case should be ignored.
ToString: This method returns a string with all of the instance variable values.
 

Write a class called PeanutButter with the following

Instance Variables
Name: The name brand of peanut butter.
Calories: The number of calories per serving assumed to be between 100 and 300 inclusively.
IsCrunchy: True if the peanut butter is crunchy and false otherwise.
Methods
Accessors and Mutators for the instance variables
Make sure in the mutators check for valid values named in the Instance Variable Section.
Equals: This method takes in another instance of Peanut Butter and only returns true if all of the instance variables match. For name case should be ignored.
ToString: This method returns a string with all of the instance variable values.
 

Write a class called Jelly with the following

Instance Variables
Name: The brand name of the Jelly
Calories: The number of calories per serving assumed to be between 50 and 200 inclusively
FruitType: The type of fruit the jelly is made from and can only be “Apple”, “Blueberry”, “Grape”, “Strawberry”, or “Tomato”.
Methods
Accessors and Mutators for the instance variables
Make sure in the mutators check for valid values named in the Instance Variable Section.
Equals: This method takes in another instance of Jelly and only returns true if all of the instance variables match. For name and fruit type case should be ignored.
ToString: This method returns a string with all of the instance variable values.
 

Write a class called PBJSandwich with the following

Instance Variables
TopSlice: An instance of type Bread representing the top slice of bread.
PeanutButter: An instance of type PeanutButter representing the peanut butter.
Jelly: An instance of type Jelly representing the jelly.
BottomSlice: An instance of type Bread representing the bottom slice of bread.
Methods
Accessors and Mutators for the instance variables
Make sure in the mutators check for valid values named in the Instance Variable Section.
Equals: This method takes in another instance of PBJSandwich and only returns true if all of the instance variables match by calling their Equals methods.
ToString: This method returns a string with all of the instance variable values.
 

Write a class called PBJFrontEnd with the following

Methods
Main Method
Create Two instances of PBJSandwich
User enters all the properties of the sandwiches
Prints out the values of the two sandwiches
Determines if they are the same sandwich
