THE COIN MACHINE!

 

Objective:

 

Upon entering a value, the program determines how many quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies to that composes said amount.

 

Requirements:

You must use the mod (%) operator as an integral part of your solution.
Example Dialog:

 

Enter a whole number from 1 to 99. The machine will determine a combination of coins.

87

87 cents in coins:

3 quarters

1 dimes

0 nickels

2 pennies

 

Solution Tests:

Is your name written as a comment in all source files?
Does the solution compile (no syntax errors)?
Is the mod operator (%) used in your solution?
Given the input, 87, does the program output:
 

87 cents in coins:

3 quarters

1 dimes

0 nickels

2 pennies

 

Given the input, 99, does the program output:
 

99 cents in coins:

3 quarters

2 dimes

0 nickels

4 pennies

Given the input, 64, does the program output:
 

64 cents in coins:

2 quarters

1 dimes

0 nickels

4 pennies

 

 

Lab Report Questions:
