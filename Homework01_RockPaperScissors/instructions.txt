Due 09/25/2020 at 11:55PM

 

Objective:

 

Write a program that simulates a game of rock, paper, scissors between a human and the computer in best 2 out of 3 rounds.

 

Requirements:

The player can enter either “rock”, “paper”, or “scissors”.
If the player enters anything other than that the computer automatically gets a point
The computer randomly selects one of the gestures
Use the Random type to make this easier
Also make sure you import java.util.Random
You can use randomly selected integers to represent the gestures
For each combination either the computer scores a point, the player scores a point, or they score neither on draws.
Rock vs Paper = Paper wins
Paper vs Scissors = Scissors wins
Scissors vs Rock = Rock wins
After 3 rounds the winner or a tie is declared
The player is then asked whether or not they want to play again, and if they do the whole process starts over.
