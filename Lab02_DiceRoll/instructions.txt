Dice Roll

 

Objective:

 

Write a program that gives the statistics of a die being rolled some number of times! 

 

Requirements:

 

The user enters a non-zero, positive, whole number of times the die is rolled. 
Make sure to check for valid inputs, so no negative numbers or 0.
If the user enters a 0 or negative value, then end the program.
Use a random number generator to pick random values from 1 to 6 and keep count on each of those. 
Give the number of times each number was “rolled”. IE randomly generated.
 

Example Dialog:

 

Enter the number of times a 6 sided die should be rolled

100

Solution Tests:

 

Is your name written as a comment in all source files?
Does the solution compile (no syntax errors)?
Enter the value 5. Do the counts match the output?
Enter the value 10. Do the counts match the output?
Enter the value -1. Does the program stop immediately?
 

 

Lab Report Questions:

Create a flow chart for your proposed solution
What is the difference between a “while loop” and a “do while loop”?
What type of logic error occurs when the Boolean expression is never false in a loop?
