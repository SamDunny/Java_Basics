Date and Time Methods

 

Objective:

 

Write a class that will test dates and times inputted by the user and determine whether or not it is valid. This will focus on the usages of methods to organize code.

 

Requirements:

 

First download the driver and put it in your project

DO NOT ALTER THE DRIVER!
Use this to run your project
 

Write a class file called DateAndTimeTester

This DOES NOT have a main method
Create the following methods
run: This method returns nothing and takes no parameters. This is called by the driver and should handle all of the input from the Scanner and dialog for the user.
isValid: returns true or false if a given String has the correct date and time. The String parameter should be formatted “MM/DD hh:mm” This method should call the methods isValidDate and isValidTime to determine this.
isValidDate: returns true or false if a given String has a correct date. The String parameter should be formatted “MM/DD” and should use the method getMonth and getDay to determine the date’s validity. Also assume February only has 28 days.
isValidTime: returns true or false if a given String has a correct time. The String parameter should be formatted “hh:mm” and should use the getHour and getMinute to determine the time’s validity. Valid times are from 1 to 12.
getMonth: returns an integer value representing the month for a given String. The String parameter is expected to be formatted “MM/DD”.
getDay: returns an integer value representing the day for a given String. The String parameter is expected to be formatted “MM/DD”.
getHour: returns an integer value representing the hour for a given String. The String parameter is expected to be formatted “hh:mm”.
getMinute: returns an integer value representing the minute for a given String. The String parameter is expected to be formatted “hh:mm”.
For reference MM/DD hh:mm is Month / Date Hour : Minute respectively
 

 

Example Dialog:

 

Enter a date and time (MM/DD hh:mm) and I will determine if it is valid

06/22 3:00

The date and time is valid!

Would you like to exit? Type "quit" to exit or press [ENTER] to continue

 

Enter a date and time (MM/DD hh:mm) and I will determine if it is valid

9/31 12:00

The date and time is not valid

Would you like to exit? Type "quit" to exit or press [ENTER] to continue

 

Enter a date and time (MM/DD hh:mm) and I will determine if it is valid

12/08 13:00

The date and time is not valid

Would you like to exit? Type "quit" to exit or press [ENTER] to continue

quit

Good bye

 

Lab Questions:

What is the purpose of a parameter for a method.
If a variable is declared in a method, then can it be used outside of that method?
If a method returns nothing, then what should its return type be?
