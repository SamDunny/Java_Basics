A Below Average Winter

 

Objective:

 

Write a program that takes in temperatures for 10 days and stores it in an array.  Find the average temperature for those 10 days, and then print the number of days and the temperatures that were strictly below the average.

 

Requirements:

Must use an Array of type “double”.
Must correctly calculate the average temperature.
Must print the average and all days and temperatures that were strictly below the average.
 

Example Dialog:

 

Welcome to the below average temperature tester program.

 

Please enter the temperature for day 1

33.0

Please enter the temperature for day 2

20.0

Please enter the temperature for day 3

41.0

Please enter the temperature for day 4

48.0

Please enter the temperature for day 5

60.0

Please enter the temperature for day 6

51.0

Please enter the temperature for day 7

29.0

Please enter the temperature for day 8

71.0

Please enter the temperature for day 9

63.0

Please enter the temperature for day 10

66.0

 

The average temperature was 48.2

The days that were below average were

Day 1 with 33.0

Day 2 with 20.0

Day 3 with 41.0

Day 4 with 48.0

Day 7 with 29.0

 

 

Solution Tests:

Is your name written as a comment in all source files?
Does the solution compile (no syntax errors)?
Given the input <33.0, 20.0, 41.0, 48.0, 60.0, 51.0, 29.0 71.0, 63.0, 66.0> does the program print out:
The average temperature was 48.2
The days that were below average were

Day 1 with 33.0

Day 2 with 20.0

Day 3 with 41.0

Day 4 with 48.0

Day 7 with 29.0

Given the input <10.0, 20.0, 30.0, 40.0, 50.0, 60.0, 70.0, 80.0, 90.0, 100.0> does the program print out:
The average temperature was 55.0
The days that were below average were

Day 1 with 10.0

Day 2 with 20.0

Day 3 with 30.0

Day 4 with 40.0

Day 5 with 50.0

Given the input <10.0, 10.0, 10.0, 10.0, 10.0, 10.0, 10.0, 10.0, 10.0, 10.0> does the program print out:
The average temperature was 10.0
The days that were below average were
